 My Articles
 
 Jack Carlson
 
My first piece is an article feature on Jack Carlson, the founder of clothing company Rowing Blazers. I conducted the interview during the height of covid when the magazine's theme was to feature stories about globalization. I decided to conduct my piece on the opposite-- featuring a clothing brand striving to preserve a dynamic preppy audience.

My second piece features a high school fashion model from Massachusetts who walked for Burberry during their virtually broadcasted show during covid. The article attempts to capture the experience of working for world renowned fashion houses when the typical environment changed drastically.
