<p>Last fall I took the class Business Ethics with Professor Vikram Bhargava for my business major. In the class I was assigned to write about a moral dilemma that had business applications and challenge myself to logically argue my position on the matter utilizing scholarly articles.</p>
<p>I chose to write about whether it was morally permissible for pharmaceutical companies to produce human euthanasia drugs. Based on my own synthesis and findings within scholarly articles I decided it was not morally permissible. The essay outlines my though process through a simple syllogism and expands on the objections or loopholes to my own argument. I attempted to fairly address each counterargument as I walk through my own argument.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ethical Permissibility of the Production of Euthanasia Drugs</strong></p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>There is much controversial debate surrounding whether or not human euthanasia is morally permissible. Inducing a person’s death no matter how much pain they are in is a moral dilemma, even if there is an arms length of distance between the agent and the act does not necessarily relieve the ethics/guilt of doing so. This is one reason why euthanasia pills look so appealing for those who are terminally ill. They can take it themselves, can choose to do so themselves without needing an external agent to do so for them etc. In order to establish a stronger, more convincing argument, we are going to grant that euthanasia in itself is ethically permissible, as the following syllogsim indicates.</p>
<p>No one should have to suffer excruciating pain if there is a better alternative</p>
<p>If there is a better alternative, it should be inflicted on the person</p>
<p>Death relieves excruciating pain</p>
<p>Death is a better alternative</p>
<p>Therefore, death should be inflicted on the person. [1,2,4]</p>
<p>Now, however, we will move onto the focus of the paper: whether it is ethically permissible for businesses to produce euthanasia drugs. In prelimary research of specific euthanasia drugs it was found that Seconal is the most common form of euthanasia drug. For many, if taken correctly, Seconal is just a strong sleeping pill. For the purpose of this paper Seconal will only be a death inducing drug. For pharmaceutical companies who wish to produce such drugs, there is significant backlash. Many companies have had to change their names (Court 1). Additionally, many have taken part in price gouging recipients of the deadly drug (Dembosky 1). In Georgia there is even such a thing as the Lethal Injection Secrecy Act which protects the identities of companies who “manufacture, prescribe or supply drugs used in executions” (Vivian 1). Based on the way businesses have behaved about the drug as well as the surrounding public, it is a relevant question to ask whether or not it is ethically permissible for companies to produce the drugs in the first place. I will argue that even if euthanasia in itself is morally permissible, it is not morally permissible for businesses to produce euthanasia drugs. I will demonstrate this argument by use of the Doctrine of Double Effect, commodification limits and criteria for blameworthiness in the patient’s death.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>THE DOCTRINE OF DOUBLE EFFECT</li>
</ol>
<p>The Doctrine of Double Effect stipulates that there is a “distinction between causing a morally grave harm as a side effect of pursuing a good end and causing a morally grave harm as a means of pursuing a good end” (McIntyre 1).</p>
<p>The best and most relevant example given to explain the Doctrine of Double Effect in regard to this paper is: “A doctor who intends to hasten the death of a terminally ill patient by injecting a large dose of morphine would act impermissibly because he intends to bring about the patient’s death. However, a doctor who intended to relieve the patient’s pain with that same dose and merely foresaw the hastening of the patient’s death would act permissibly (McIntyre 1).” The same action can be perceived in two different ways. One of which is impermissible and the other where it is permissible.</p>
<p>The New Catholic Encyclopedia provides four conditions for the application of the principle of double effect: The act itself must be morally good or at least indifferent. The agent may not positively will the bad effect but may permit it. If he could attain the good effect without the bad effect he should do so. The bad effect is sometimes said to be indirectly voluntary. The good effect must flow from the action at least as immediately (in the order of causality, though not necessarily in the order of time) as the bad effect. In other words the good effect must be produced directly by the action, not by the bad effect. Otherwise the agent would be using a bad means to a good end, which is never allowed. The good effect must be sufficiently desirable to compensate for the allowing of the bad effect (McIntyre 1).</p>
<p>Let’s narrow it even further, let’s grant that under the Doctrine of Double Effect, pharmaceutical companies are ethically permitted to sell a drug with potentially fatal side effects (Masek 490-491). Regardless of Masek’s claim there are distinctions between the two. The biggest one being that with euthanasia drugs, death is not a likely side effect, it is a guaranteed end. Let’s apply the Doctrine of Double Effect to businesses who produce euthanasia drugs:</p>
<p>First Criterion: <em>Is the act itself immoral?</em></p>
<p>For businesses to create deadly drugs in itself is immoral. The production of the drug assumes use of the drug which then assumes death by the drug. By even creating it, it is willing death into being an opportunity/option to someone. Now let’s grant that it is not immoral to produce a deadly drug if no one uses it. While this may be true, it is unrealistic and also pointless. Why would you create a drug, put time and money into production, distribution, patents and all of the other assumed costs if no one were to use it? Realistically, the company would not. So we assume that someone is going to use the drug (meaning induce death) and that would not be able to happen if the business had not created that drug to use in the first place.</p>
<p>Second Criterion: <em>Are we actually willing the bad effect to occur?</em></p>
<p>The business does not will people to die, they cannot will people to take their drug and they cannot will sickness upon people. For this reason, the second criterion does not support my argument. For the Doctrine to be accepted as morally permissible, all four criteria would have to refute my argument, not just one. Therefore, by already establishing that criteria one supports my argument has already made it impossible for the second to ruin it. I do however acknowledge this and will focus on 3-5 .</p>
<p>2a: Can we obtain the good effects without the bad effects? If we can we should. Here is an important distinction: if we were talking about euthanasia in itself, the sick person is not able to get the good effect: diminished pain, without the bad effect: death. However, we instead describe a business. For a business, the good effect of producing the drug would be profits, happy shareholders, increased prestige, bigger salaries etc. The bad effect is the death of other people. Here, we can absolutely obtain the good effects without the bad effects. Pharmaceutical companies almost never produce one drug or if they do, pivoting to produce different drugs is extremely easy with their business model. Their company would be able to continue to make profits even if they did not produce Seconal.</p>
<p>Third Criterion: <em>Do the bad effects result as directly from the acts as the good effects?</em></p>
<p>The business’s good effect (profit) does stem directly from the bad effects. The profit will come when doctors buy the drugs but they will only have sustained profits if the doctors continue having demand. The demand therefore generates profits and increases in deaths are what increase demand. This means the company is using bad means to a good end, which is prohibited under the Doctrine.</p>
<p>Fourth Criterion: <em>Are the good effects insufficient to offset the bad effects?</em></p>
<p>I think that it would be logical to assume that the good effects of “profit” for a company do not offset the bad effects of life being lost. Additionally, I would argue it is actually wrong to take profit for a means to end life in general which will be discussed in the next section of the paper. From the Doctrine of Double Effect we can conclude that it is not morally permissible for a company to sell euthanasia drugs.</p>
<p>2. MARKET LIMITS</p>
<p>Before we make the argument for market limits, we must first establish that a company is in fact the agent of death. Just because a company has an arms length distance from administering Seconal, does not mean they are ethically exempt from the consequences. If the business had not created the drug, it would never have been an option for doctors to utilize on patients or patients to use on themselves. This places culpability onto the business who engineered and sold it.</p>
<p>Now one may argue that even if the business did not create the drug, then the ill patient would have found another means to their end. This is true, however it is ethically permissible because there would no longer be an arms length of distance to an external agent. The agent (the patient) would have created or found a solution on their own and would have administered it themselves. This does in fact pass by the standards of the Doctrine of Double Effect as morally sufficient. The problem comes in when a business is the one promoting and selling the euthanasia drug.</p>
<p>Now that we have established that the business is ethically responsible for the deaths that occur from the drug even though there is an arms length distance, we can assess commodification limits.</p>
<p>There are many things that the general public believes that money should not be able to buy. This means placing a limit on what is able to become a “commodity.” Under this argument there are several moral obligations to take into consideration (Brennan and Jaworski). These would include wrongful exploitation, misallocation, rights violations and paternalism, etc. All of which are semiotic objections meaning that they rely on the idea that markets in certain goods communicate the wrong attitude (Brennan and Jaworski). For the purposes of our argument we will only be looking at paternalism. Paternalism suggests that some markets (like those that deal in drugs) may cause people to make self-destructive choices (Brennan and Jaworski). Euthansia drugs can classify as being relevant in this objection.</p>
<p>Brennan and Jaworski continue their argument to ultimately state that in reality, semiotic arguments do not stand. The semiotics are just socially constructed and can be changed in order for the commodity to be successfully put into a market (Brennan and Jaworski). Here we can grant that from the first part of their argument, my thesis fails. However, their paper additionally argued in the second half that if a person can do something for free, ultimately they should be able to do it for money (commoditize an object) (Brennan and Joawrski). Here, my argument holds.</p>
<p>If it is wrong to do something for free, then it is also wrong to do it for money</p>
<p>It is wrong to kill someone for free</p>
<p>Therefore, it is also wrong to kill someone for money [1,2]</p>
<p>As we had established prior, just because a company has an arms length of distance from the administering of their drug does not mean they have less responsibility for killing a person. Because it is not ok to kill someone for free, (assassins, murderers), then it is also not ok to do it for money (companies that produce euthanasia drugs). We have now established that it is not ethically permissible for companies to commoditize euthanasia drugs.</p>
<p>This is extremely relevant especially pertaining to Valeant pharmaceuticals who not only sell the euthanasia drug, but price gouge on the drug as well. In this real life instance, the pharmaceutical company actually made it extremely difficult for patients to afford the drug they may have needed very desperately which defeats the argument that companies often make of “we want sick people to have a way out.” By making the drug so excessively expensive they are only putting up barriers for the people who need the drug (Dembosky).</p>
<p>3. BLAMEWORTHINESS</p>
<p>The last part of my argument will discuss the criteria for blameworthiness. To assert blameworthiness we must first grant that the company is an agent (a normal affective being with cognitive capabilities) (Bhargava). Since the company is assumedly made up of fully cognitive human beings we can say that the company is an agent. Next we have to establish whether or not the company had intention (Bhargava).</p>
<p>Intention is set on a scalar notion where intentionality can be (Bhargava):</p>
<p>Purposeful (the aim of your action)</p>
<p>Knowing Reckless (knowing about the risks but you still perform the action)</p>
<p>Negligence (you should have been aware of the risk)</p>
<p>Since the company is producing Seconal knowing that the only purpose of the drug is to kill someone, we can say that their intentionality is purposeful as death is the aim of their action.</p>
<p>Then we must determine if the company is also causally responsible (Bhargava). Here the argument becomes slightly more difficult. In normal examples of being causally responsible, the agent would directly cause the action. Example: an agent rams their car into someone’s home. Because the pharmaceutical company does not physically put the Seconal into a patient’s mouth it can be argued that they are not causally responsible. However, examples of not being causally responsible also do not effectively address our situation. In cases where the person is not causally responsible and only possess intention, the act is not committed by them in any remote manner. For example, Max had intention to kill Michael. Before Max could kill Michael, Ben killed Michael. Max was not causally responsible even though he had intention. I think there is a difference in our situation. Since the company created the drug that they do administer to doctors who use it on patients, they are somewhat causally responsible. This would be the equivalent situation where Max gave the gun to Ben and suggested he use it on Michael. The company is giving the pills to the doctors and saying use it on patients. If Ben had not been given the gun by Max the entire situation would have never happened at all. This implicated Max and does give him a great deal of causality even if it was not direct. Here I grant for these reasons that the drug companies are to some extent causally responsible.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally we must conclude that there were no excuses, like being forced into producing the drug (Bhargava). Here I would argue that corporations are normally acting upon free will and motives of profit, there does not seem to be any indication of being forced into producing the drug by external pressure. Because all of these requirements hold, we can conclude that companies responsible for producing euthanasia drugs are also blameworthy for the deaths induced by the drugs.</p>
<p>4. OBJECTIONS</p>
<p>The greatest objection I have received so far has been in regard to other companies that produce deadly products. If we rule out companies being able to produce euthanasia drugs would it not mean we also have to rule out companies with other kinds of deadly products like bleach, guns, knives, gasoline, alcohol etc? While these products can most definitely become deadly to humans, there is one massive distinction. While clorox produces bleach that when ingested can kill you, they are producing the bleach without the intention to kill a human. Bleach is not specifically engineered in order to kill a human nor was it produced for that purpose. The purpose of bleach is to be used as a cleaning product. The same cannot be said for euthanasia drugs. Euthanasia drugs are enginerred with a singular purpose in mind and it is explicitly to kill a human.</p>
<p>I can see how the argument for guns may be slightly different. Many times guns are specifically used to kill other humans. However, once again they are not manufactured for the sole purpose of killing another human. Guns can be used to kill animals, defensive purposes, or just plain old target practice. Realistically, if a person merely wanted to possess a gun and let it sit in their basement for peace of mind, that would be a reasonable use of that gun. With euthanasia drugs, however, this is not the case. They will be used. They cannot sit around in a basement, be used for defensive purposes and so on. Euthanasia drugs’ only use is to kill a human.</p>
<p>A second objection I have recieved has been, “how can euthanasia itself be ethically permissible, but not ethically permissible to produce the drug?” I feel as though the best response to this would be this: you are allowed to do anything you’d like to yourself (especially in dire circumstances such as terminal illness), however you would not allow someone else to do anything they’d like to you. For example, if I decided I wanted to take cocaine, then I am allowed to do so. It may be frowned upon, but ultimately it is my own body and I’ll do as I wish. However, if someone else or an outside force played a hand in my decision to take cocaine, that would not be ok with me. I find it is the same with euthanasia. If a person decides that is what they want to do in their last years of terminal illness, they are allowed to do so. However, a company producing and profiting off of that decision is not ethically permissible. The person taking the drug is taking it in order to relieve a great amount of pain and did not decide upon that choice lightly. The distinction is that companies are promoting doing so for the selfish benefit of profit. The two are very different.</p>
<p>Lastly, and what I believe to be the strongest objection, is that businesses are not causally responsible. This is undoubtedly a weaker part of my argument. Ultimately, we must define exactly what causally responsible entails in order to rule out that the business was not in some way causally responsible. I believe in all circumstances, especially in drug circumstances, that businesses play a role in the outcome of what happens to a person after they take the drug. Any product can cause death and companies should know and feel that they played a hand in whatever product caused such grave danger. With cleaning companies, gun companies etc they should work towards making it safer for consumers to use. But in the case of euthanasia drugs there is no way to prevent the death “side effect” and for that reason I believe they are causally responsible because they put the pill in the hand of the consumer.</p>
<p>5. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>While it is unlikely that businesses will stop producing these drugs on the basis of a philosophical argument on ethics, I think it is important to note the importance of the argument nonetheless. Patients who desperately need these drugs may not be able to afford them which defeats the purpose of them (yet another reason why businesses in the private sector should not be producing the drugs.) Ultimately, it is not ethically permissible for businesses to produce euthanasia drugs even if it euthanasia in itself is ethically permissible. We have examined three distinct theories: Doctrine of Double Effect, commodification limits and blameworthiness criterion in order to separately support my claims. Regardless of which theory is ultimately used, (individually or in tandem) each has demonstrated in different manners that production of and profit from such drugs is ethically impermissible. Businesses failed to prove ethically redeemable qualities in producing the drugs in order meet the criteria for the Doctrine. Businesses failed to be classified as a marketable commodity. But most importantly, businesses succeeded in meeting the criteria for blameworthiness for user’s death.</p>
