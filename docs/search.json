    "text": "Jack Carlson\nMy first piece is an article feature on Jack Carlson, the founder of clothing company Rowing Blazers. I conducted the interview during the height of covid when the magazine’s theme was to feature stories about globalization. I decided to conduct my piece on the opposite– featuring a clothing brand striving to preserve a dynamic preppy audience.\n\nAstrid Voss\nMy second piece features a high school fashion model from Massachusetts who walked for Burberry during their virtually broadcasted show during covid. The article attempts to capture the experience of working for world renowned fashion houses when the typical environment changed drastically.\n\nNew Balance\nMy third piece is based off of a paper I wrote for a college marketing class. The goal was to find a company caught in an interesting part of the product life cycle. New Balance was featured because in 2021 they were experiencing a large overhaul in brand image and marketing.\nPlease find the hyperlinks to each article below:"

    "text": "We will start by loading our libraries in order to run future lines of code.\nHere, I loaded my Georgia votes into my R from the excel spreadsheet by running the code below. First I wanted the code to show the senate results so I pulled only the senate sheet from the excel code. Next I wanted the governor results so I pulled only the governor sheet.\n\n\nCode\n#import the GA election data for this assignment\n\n#GA senate\nsenate_results <- read_excel(here(\"ga_votes.xlsx\"), sheet = \"senate\")\n\n#GA governor\ngovernor_results <- read_excel(here(\"ga_votes.xlsx\"), sheet = \"governor\")\n\n\nTwo columns in particular to highlight that we’ll use to examine how the Republican Senate and Governor candidates did compared with former President Trump’s performance in 2020:\n\npct_r_above_trump. This column calculates the difference in percentage points between what the 2022 Republican candidate got (pct_r_2022) and what Trump got two years earlier (pct_r_2020). A negative value means the candidate did worse than Trump, a positive value means they did better.\nis_r_above_trump. This companion columns is a so-called “flag” column, which provides a Yes/No as to whether the Republican candidate did better or worse than Trump. In other words, is the pct_r_above_trump value positive or negative.\n\nNext, I created a column chart that shows how many counties the Republican candidates did better vs. worse than Trump. In doing this I used ggplot to pull the senate results data then wanted the x axis to be the counties and the height of the columns to be the percent above trump of the winning candidate. I then used geomcol to create the bar chart.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(senate_results, aes(x = county, y = pct_r_above_trump)) +\n    geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I made one the race for Governor with the same code as above.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(governor_results, aes(x = county, y = pct_r_above_trump)) +\n    geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Senate race, I created a chart that shows the top 10 biggest drops between the Republican candidate and Trump.\n\n\nCode\nnew_senate_results <- senate_results %>% \n  arrange(desc(pct_r_above_trump)) %>%\n  head(10) \n\n\nggplot(new_senate_results, aes(x = reorder(county, -pct_r_above_trump), y = pct_r_above_trump)) +\n    geom_col() \n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Senate race, I created a chart that shows the top 10 counties highest margins of victory for the Democratic candidate. Note: in order to calulate the margin of victory you will subtract the republican results from the democrat results in 2022.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nmargin_of_victory_data <- senate_results %>% \n  mutate(MOV = (pct_d_2022 - pct_r_2022))\n\nmargin_of_victory_senate <- margin_of_victory_data %>% \n  arrange(desc(MOV))\n\ntop_ten_MOV <- head(margin_of_victory_senate,10)\n\nggplot(top_ten_MOV, aes(x = reorder(county, -MOV), y = MOV)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I did the same as the previous code but for the race for governor.\n\n\nCode\nmargin_of_victory_data_2 <- governor_results %>% \n  mutate(MOV_governor = (pct_d_2022 - pct_r_2022))\n\nmargin_of_victory_governor <- margin_of_victory_data_2 %>% \n  arrange(desc(MOV_governor))\n\ntop_ten_MOV_gov <- head(margin_of_victory_governor,10)\n\nggplot(top_ten_MOV_gov, aes(x = reorder(county, -MOV_governor), y = MOV_governor)) +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\n\nI used tmap to create maps in this section.\nTo help start things out for you, we’re going to download a geospatial/map dataset with the county boundaries for Georgia. We’ll use the tigris package to do this.\n\n\nCode\ncounties_geo <- tigris::counties(state = \"GA\", resolution = \"20m\", cb = TRUE)\n\n\nRetrieving data for the year 2020\n\n\n\n  |

package.\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(counties_geo) + \n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Senate race, I created a choropleth (shaded) map of Georgia counties that shows where the Republican candidate for Senate did better vs. worse than Trump.\n\n\nCode\nsenatemap <- inner_join(counties_geo, senate_results, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(senatemap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"is_r_above_trump\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I’ve done the same as above but for the governor race.\n\n\nCode\ngovmap <- inner_join(counties_geo, governor_results, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(govmap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"is_r_above_trump\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Senate race, I created a choropleth map that shows the margins of victory for the Democratic candidate. To do that I needed to compare the Democratic candidate’s percentage (pct_d_2022) with the Republican’s (pct_r_2022) to calculate the margin of victory for each county.\n\n\nCode\nMOVsenmap <- inner_join(counties_geo, margin_of_victory_senate, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(MOVsenmap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"MOV\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\nVariable(s) \"MOV\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I did the same as above but this time for the governor race.\n\n\nCode\nMOVgovmap <- inner_join(counties_geo, margin_of_victory_governor, by = c(\"GEOID\" = \"fipsCode\"))\n\ntmap_mode(mode = \"plot\")\n\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n\nCode\ntm_shape(MOVgovmap) +\n  tm_polygons(\"MOV_governor\", id = \"GEOID\")\n\n\nVariable(s) \"MOV_governor\" contains positive and negative values, so midpoint is set to 0. Set midpoint = NA to show the full spectrum of the color palette."
